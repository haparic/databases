>= greater than or equal to, WHERE age >=21
<= less than or equal to, WHERE height <=5'4"
> greater than, WHERE real_numbers > 0
< less than, WHERE price < 50
<> greater than or less than, WHERE ph_level <10 OR >3
BETWEEN returns true if statement is in the range made WHERE price BETWEEN 20 AND 50
NOT returns row where the expression is false WHERE NOT number <30
OR looks for one of the expressions to be true WHERE weather ='Sunny' OR weather='Cloudy'

AND is used only when all expressions are correct WHERE age=20 and job='student'
ALL returns true for any value meets the conditions= WHERE age= ALL
